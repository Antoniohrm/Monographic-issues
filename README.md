This Python program simulates the well-known Rutherford's gold foil experiment, by randomly "shooting" alpha particles through a hole of kwown radius to a gold nucleus.
It calculates the angle traced by the particle and with that, the Rutherford scattering cross section, both the theoretical value and the obtained value for each interval of deflect angle. Then it plots both values.

This code uses Python 3 and the Matplotib library for plotting.
